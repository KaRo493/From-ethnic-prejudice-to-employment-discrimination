This folder provides with replication data and codes for Table 1 and Table 2 of the paper. These tables were made using a panel of the Hungarian Labor Force Survey (HLFS).  The Data folder contains the pooled and cleaned dataset of the waves of HLFS that include all the necessary variables. The Analysis folder contains two Stata program files for each of the two tables. The code for Table 1 (lfs_panel_table1.do) includes the construction of the HLFS panel as well.

The Hungarian LFS is proprietary data, see Replication_package_overview.docx
