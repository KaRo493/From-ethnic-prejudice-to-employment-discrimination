"The Census_2001 folder contains the replication codes of the main results using the 2001 Hungarian census data (instead of the 2011 data). The data_processing_census2001.do program file in the Processing folder generates the individual-level dataset (as similar as possible to the 2011 dataset) for the employment regressions that had been constructed from the original census data in the CERS-HCSO database. The regressions_census2001.do program file in the Analysis folder estimates employment regressions of the same form as those estimated on the 2011 sample."
