The Census 2011 folder contains program files that produce the main results of the paper. The do file named data_processing_census2011.do in the Processing folder shows how the individual-level dataset for the employment regressions was constructed from the original census data in the CERS-HCSO Databank. The Analysis folder consists of four different program files. The first one (1_regressions_census_2011.do) estimates the employment regressions. The second file (2_bootstrap_se_2011.do) estimates bootstrap standard errors for the coefficients of the variables that include interaction with the variable Jobbik. The third file (3_sectoral_regressions_2011.do) estimates the placebo regressions in which we replace the shares of small enterprises by the sectoral shares in the local labor market. The last code (4_lincom_simu.do) conducts the simulation exercise for the predictions in Table 6.
