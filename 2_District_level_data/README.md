We provide a Stata dataset covering all the district-level variables required for the analysis in the paper, collected from a number of different sources. This dataset can be used to replicate the residual Jobbik share variable, district-level maps, or simply to check the relationship between the main indicators of the analysis. Variables calculated by using individual-level census data are based on the estimation sample.
